## Part3

In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.

We will also be writing unit and integration tests for the backend. After we have covered testing, we will take a look at implementing user authentication and authorization.
